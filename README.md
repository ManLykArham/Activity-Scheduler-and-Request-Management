# 📅 Activity Scheduler and Request Management

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

This project focuses on implementing an **activity selection algorithm** to efficiently schedule the **maximum number of non-overlapping requests** based on their start and finish times. Users can add new requests, display the list of all activities, and find the largest set of activities that can be scheduled without conflict. Additionally, I integrated an **insertion sort algorithm** to organise requests by their finish times, ensuring the scheduling is as optimal as possible. ⏰

## ✨ Features

- **Add Requests**: Input activities with start and finish times.
- **Display Requests**: View all activities in the system.
- **Optimal Scheduling**: Calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping requests using the activity selection algorithm.
- **Sorted by Finish Time**: Activities are sorted by their finish time for optimal scheduling.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Add Requests**:
   - Input the activity's ID, start time, and finish time.
   
2. **Display Requests**:
   - View the entire list of activities added to the system.

3. **Maximise Scheduled Requests**:
   - The system calculates and displays the maximum number of non-overlapping activities based on start and finish times.

### 📊 Example Usage

- Add requests: `ID1` (9:00-10:00), `ID2` (10:30-11:30).
- The program schedules the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

**Expected Output**:  
`"ID1, ID2"`.
